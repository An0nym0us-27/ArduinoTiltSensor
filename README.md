# ArduinoTiltSensor

The purpose of this project was to implement a tilt sensor on the Arduino uno.

The tilt sensor is triggered when the sensor is physically titled.
In this implementation, if the sensor is not tilted, the on-board LED will be on.
If the sensor is tilted, it will turn off the on-board LED and display to the serial window that it is tilted.
